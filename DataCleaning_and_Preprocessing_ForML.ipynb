The algorithms is given a set of data that has both the predictor variable and the outcome variable.

        "1. **Labeled Data**: We have data about different people's BMIs, and we also know whether they are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. This is like having labels on the data.\n",

        "3. **Output Labels**: The output labels are the categories we want to predict, like \"underweight,\" \"normal weight,\" \"overweight,\" or \"obese.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Learning Process**: We use the data we have to learn how height, weight, and BMI relate to each other. We learn from examples to understand what combination of height and weight corresponds to each BMI category.\n",
